# flask-sqlalchemy-top-10-movies
Database of top 10 movies using flask, bootstrap5, wtforms, sql, sqlalchemy, and API. HTML and CSS are also included.

The program renders wtforms using flask that allows user to search for movies from https://www.themoviedb.org/ using API. The selected movie can then be
added to the database, rated, and ordered and ranked according to rating. It also allows for the user to update rating and review as well as delete a movie from 
database. Please find below video of the project:
